device-net
==========

This has to do with nets of devices.  Expect node.js components and some embedded toy projects, like Arduino projects. 


NOTE to reader: I have been neglecting some of my on-line projects. I have been working at a job for a while. 
And, since that eneded I have been reading up on the mathematics and proabability, etc. So, some of that can slow down.
Looking for the next job cannot slow down. But, there should be some development time.
