device-nodes
============

This has to do with nets of devices.  Expect node.js components and some embedded toy projects, like Arduino projects. 


The name device-nodes is used because there should be node.js management of devices.
I almost named this device-net. But, if you look that up you will find the CAN industry already has that.
Not that CAN can't be part of this.

Note to reader: I have been doing some other things. So, I might turn on some programming juice about now. 

To start with I am uploading one node.js application file. This is for an example. Check again in a few days for more. 

The first file is about streaming some media onto a server. It is quite short but worked pretty well a few years ago.

That's all for now. If I make small changes each day, the reason for other possible projects will become clearer.
